custom knn
report
try different methods - random forests, nn -------DONE------ randomforest, svm, knn ----- rnn, extra-trees, nearest centroid


report --- areas to cover


- What all models did we try, which one we chose, with whys and hows.
- Implementations:
    --------------------------------------------
    Model           | Accuracy      | Time
    --------------------------------------------
    SVM             |
    Random Forests  | 
    kNN             | 99.984%       | 0.0995s
    custom knn      | 44.565%       | 79.002s
    rNN             | 99.332%       | 0.0879s
